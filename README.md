## üìñ Description

This project presents an **IoT-based Smart Parking System using RFID technology** to tackle the growing problem of parking in urban areas.  
As the number of vehicles increases daily, finding a parking spot has become a significant challenge, leading to traffic congestion, wasted fuel, and frustration for drivers.

Our system automates the parking process, allowing users to find available parking slots quickly and efficiently. It uses a combination of sensors and cloud connectivity to provide real-time data on parking availability, which can be accessed remotely.  
This not only saves time and fuel for drivers but also enhances safety and optimizes the use of parking space.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Real-Time Slot Monitoring:** Uses IR sensors to provide live updates on the availability of parking slots.  
* **Automated Entry & Exit:** Servo motors control the gates, which open automatically for authorized vehicles detected by the RFID system.  
* **Cloud Connectivity:** Parking data is sent to the Blynk cloud, allowing users to check slot availability remotely via a mobile or web app.  
* **Reduced Traffic & Pollution:** By minimizing the time spent searching for parking, the system helps reduce traffic congestion and unnecessary fuel consumption.  
* **Enhanced Security:** The RFID system ensures that only authorized persons can take vehicles from the parking area, improving overall safety.  
* **Cost-Effective Management:** Automation reduces the need for human operators, saving on labor costs.

## üöÄ Future Scope

This project has the potential for several future enhancements:

* **AI and Machine Learning Integration:** AI could be used to predict parking demand and optimize space allocation.  
* **Automated Self-Parking:** The system could be integrated with self-parking vehicles to fully automate the parking process.  
* **Live Parking Counter:** A real-time counter could show the exact number of available slots to motorists before they enter the facility.  
* **Online Payment & Booking:** Adding features for online payments and pre-booking of parking slots would further enhance the user experience.
